00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.100
I don't care if Monday's blue

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.500
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.800
Thursday I don't care about you

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.400
It's Friday I'm in love

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.900
Monday you can fall apart

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.700
Thursday doesn't even start

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.700
It's Friday I'm in love

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.100
Saturday wait

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.700
And Sunday always comes too late

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.500
But Friday never hesitate

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.800
I don't care if Monday's black

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.600
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.500
Thursday never looking back

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.000
It's Friday I'm in love

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.200
Monday you can hold your head

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.100
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.800
Or Thursday watch the walls instead

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.100
It's Friday I'm in love

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.000
Saturday wait

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.550
And Sunday always comes too late

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.700
But Friday never hesitate

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.500
Dressed up to the eyes

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.500
It's a wonderful surprise

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.400
To see your shoes and
your spirits rise

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500
Throwing out your frown

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.800
And just smiling at the sound

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.900
And as sleek as a shriek

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Spinning round and round

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.400
Always take a big bite

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500
It's such a gorgeous sight

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.000
To see you eat in the
middle of the night

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.600
You can never get enough

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.600
Enough of this stuff

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.600
It's Friday

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.650
I'm in love

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.100
I don't care if Monday's blue

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.700
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.800
Thursday I don't care about you

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.700
It's Friday, I'm in love

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.900
Monday you can fall apart

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.600
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.750
Thursday doesn't even start

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.700
It's Friday I'm in love

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.700
